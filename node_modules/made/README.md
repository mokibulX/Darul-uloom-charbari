Made is a simple reactive build tool.
If a file changes, every dependency of this file will be rebuilt.
This project is heavily inspired by [tup](http://gittup.org/tup/).

The build system needs a simple configuration file in the current folder.
It is composed of shell commands on every line starting with '$ '.
Every line beginning with a different character will currently be ignored.

Files being watched are enclosed in '[]'.
Output files are enclosed in '{}'.

```bash
$ cp [*.txt] {build/%b.txt}
$ cp [.hgignore] {.gitignore}
$ cp [.gitignore] {.hgignore}
this line is ignored
```

The first line copies every changed *.txt file to the folder "build".
The second line copies .hgignore to .gitignore if it is changed.
The third line does the same in reverse (probably not a good idea :-)).

When made is executed it will run indefinitely and execute the above commands
on every matching file change (addition or write).
